    "notes": "- 🎨 **Reaction Test Visual Redesign:** The visual feedback for LEFT/RIGHT reaction targets has been completely redesigned. The old arrow pointing from HOME to the target zone has been replaced with a large, simple, centered horizontal neon arrow indicating direction (left or right). The FRONT target remains unaffected visually (beep only, no flash or arrow).\n- 📏 **Larger Reaction Arrow:** The size, thickness, glow effect, and associated font of the new reaction direction arrow have been significantly increased for better visibility on all screen sizes (arrow length: 50% of screen width, thickness: 2.5x larger, glow blur: 31px).\n- 📈 **Auto-Analysis in Jump Report:** Automatic analysis has been added to the Jump test report, providing instant performance insights without manual review.\n- 🐞 **Critical Side Jump Fix:** Resolved a major bug that caused jumps to be missed or not counted correctly, ensuring accurate results.\n- ⚡ **Revamped Side Jump Logic:** Redesigned with a 'Virtual Barrier.' Tracking now focuses on foot displacement rather than body center, significantly improving accuracy for rapid jumps.\n- 📊 **New Side Jump Report:** The analytics report for the Side Jump test has been completely redesigned to provide clearer and more insightful data.\n- ⏱️ **Reaction Time Upgrade:** The test now includes the 'Average Time' metric, providing more comprehensive performance insights.\n- 🚀 **Performance Optimization:** Fixed FPS drop issues; processing is now stable at 30-40 FPS.\n- 🧠 **Enhanced Accuracy:** Integrated a Kalman Filter for smoother and precise motion detection."
